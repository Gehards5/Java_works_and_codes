# Java_works_and_codes
In this repository you can see what I have done as a Java developer in companies like Scandic Fusion, where I worked.
This is the place where you can look to my code I wroted and upgraded at Scandic Fusion. Unfortunately, I can't show
you all my code as I don't want to face some legal actions from my previous employer.
